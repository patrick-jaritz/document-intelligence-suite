# 🔍 Check OCR Logs - The Real Issue

**Date**: 2025-01-15

## 🐛 **The Real Problem**

The embeddings ARE being generated, but the OCR is only extracting:
```
"Google Vision API test successful! API key is configured and ready to process documents."
```

Instead of the actual PDF content!

---

## 🎯 **Check OCR Function Logs**

### In Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/joqnpibrfzqflyogrkht
2. **Edge Functions** → **`process-pdf-ocr`** → **Logs** tab
3. Upload the PDF again
4. Watch what appears in the logs

**Look for**:
- ✅ "Processing PDF with google-vision"
- ✅ "OCR completed: X characters extracted"
- ❌ Any errors about API keys
- ❌ Any errors about PDF processing

---

## 🤔 **Most Likely Causes**

### Cause 1: Google Vision API Key Issue (80% probability)

**Symptoms**:
- OCR function returns test message as fallback
- Real PDF text not extracted

**Check**: Look for error in logs like:
```
Google Vision API error: API key not valid
```

**Fix**: Verify the Google Vision API key is set correctly

### Cause 2: PDF Upload Issue (15% probability)

**Symptoms**:
- PDF data not reaching the OCR function
- Function receives empty or corrupted data

**Check**: Look for logs showing PDF size = 0

### Cause 3: OCR Function Returning Test Data (5% probability)

**Symptoms**:
- Function is hardcoded to return test message
- Or falling back to test data on error

## 🛠️ **How to Check**

### Option 1: Dashboard Logs (Easiest)

1. Open the `process-pdf-ocr` logs
2. Upload PDF
3. Share what you see in the logs

### Option 2: CLI Logs

```bash
cd /Users/patrickjaritz/CODE/document-intelligence-suite
supabase functions logs process-pdf-ocr --project-ref joqnpibrfzqflyogrkht --tail
```

Then upload a PDF and watch the output.

---

## 📝 **What to Share**

After uploading the PDF, share the logs from `process-pdf-ocr` function.

Look for:
- Any error messages
- What the function is returning
- The extracted text length

---

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

You can also test if it's a consistent issue by trying a different PDF:

1. Upload a **very simple PDF** (like a single page with just "Hello World")
2. Check if it extracts "Hello World" or the test message
3. If it still shows test message → OCR function issue
4. If it extracts "Hello World" → Issue specific to your PDF
