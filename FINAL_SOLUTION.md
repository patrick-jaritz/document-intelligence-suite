# üéØ RAG Issue - Final Analysis & Solution

## Root Cause Identified

After extensive debugging, we found:

1. ‚úÖ **RPC function works perfectly** when called from SQL
2. ‚úÖ **Embedding format is correct** (starts with `[`, ends with `]`, 1536 dimensions, 19232 chars)
3. ‚úÖ **All parameters are correct** (threshold: 0.3, filename matches, documentId: null)
4. ‚ùå **Supabase JS client RPC returns 0 chunks** when called from Edge Function

**Conclusion**: The Supabase JavaScript client has a bug or limitation when calling RPC functions with large TEXT parameters (~19KB).

## The Solution

Since we can't use the RPC reliably from the JS client, we need to implement the vector search **directly in the Edge Function** without using RPC.

### Option 1: Use PostgREST Directly
Call the PostgreSQL `<=>` operator directly via a raw SQL query instead of using `.rpc()`.

### Option 2: Switch to pgvector REST API
Use the Supabase REST API with custom filtering.

### Option 3: Simplify the RAG (Temporary Workaround)
For now, just return chunks by filename without vector search, then let the LLM filter relevant content.

## Recommended Next Steps

Given the time spent debugging, I recommend **Option 3 as a quick fix** to get your RAG working immediately, then we can refine it later.

**Would you like me to**:
1. Implement the simple workaround (just return chunks by filename)?
2. Try to implement raw SQL vector search (more complex)?
3. File a bug report with Supabase and move on to other features?

Let me know and I'll proceed! üöÄ
