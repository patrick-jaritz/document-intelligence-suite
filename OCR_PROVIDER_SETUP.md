## üéØ Summary

**The 3 "Missing" providers are self-hosted services, not API-key services!**

To use them:
1. **Don't configure API keys** (they don't use API keys)
2. **Deploy the services** to cloud infrastructure
3. **Configure service URLs** in Supabase environment variables
4. Currently: **Optional** - you can use OpenAI Vision, Google Vision, etc. instead

**Recommendation**: If you want to use them, deploy the services first, then configure the URLs. For now, you have 5 working OCR providers already configured!
