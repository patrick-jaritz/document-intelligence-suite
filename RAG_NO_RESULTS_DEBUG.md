# 🔍 RAG "No Results" - Complete Debug Guide

## ✅ **What We Know**

1. **Database has chunks** ✓ (you confirmed this)
2. **RAG query returns 200 OK** ✓ (working correctly)
3. **But returns "No relevant information found"** ❌

This means the **vector search** is working, but either:
- The similarity threshold (0.7 = 70%) is too high
- The filename filter doesn't match
- The embeddings don't match your question semantically

---

## 🎯 **Most Likely Cause: Similarity Threshold Too High**

The `match_document_chunks` function uses a **0.7 similarity threshold** (70%). This means:
- Only chunks with ≥70% semantic similarity are returned
- If your question doesn't closely match the document wording, it gets filtered out

---

## 🧪 **Quick Test: Run This SQL**

### Test 1: Check What Chunks Exist

```sql
SELECT 
  filename,
  chunk_index,
  substring(chunk_text, 1, 300) as preview
FROM document_chunks
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Copy the `filename` exactly** - you'll need it for Test 2.

---

### Test 2: Test Vector Search with Low Threshold

Replace `'YOUR_FILENAME.pdf'` with the exact filename from Test 1:

```sql
-- Test with very low threshold to see if ANY matches exist
SELECT 
  substring(chunk_text, 1, 200) as text_preview,
  similarity,
  chunk_index,
  filename
FROM match_document_chunks(
  query_embedding := (
    -- Use first chunk's embedding as test
    SELECT embedding::text 
    FROM document_chunks 
    WHERE filename = 'YOUR_FILENAME.pdf'  -- Replace this!
    ORDER BY created_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1
  ),
  match_threshold := 0.1,  -- Very low (10%) for testing
  match_count := 10,
  filter_document_id := NULL,
  filter_filename := 'YOUR_FILENAME.pdf'  -- Replace this!
)
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ **Good**: You see chunks with similarity > 0.7
  → Your embeddings are working, just need to lower threshold or ask better questions
- ⚠️ **Medium**: You see chunks but all similarity < 0.7
  → Need to lower the threshold in the code
- ❌ **Bad**: No results at all
  → Filename filter issue or embeddings are NULL

---

### Test 3: Check Without Filename Filter

```sql
-- Test without filename filter to rule out filter issues
SELECT 
  substring(chunk_text, 1, 200) as text_preview,
  similarity,
  filename
FROM match_document_chunks(
  query_embedding := (
    SELECT embedding::text 
    FROM document_chunks 
    ORDER BY created_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1
  ),
  match_threshold := 0.1,
  match_count := 10,
  filter_document_id := NULL,
  filter_filename := NULL  -- No filter
)
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

If this works but Test 2 doesn't, the filename filter is the issue.

---

## 🔧 **Quick Fix: Lower Similarity Threshold**

If Test 2 shows chunks with similarity between 0.4-0.7, we need to lower the threshold.

I can update the `rag-query` function to use **0.5** (50%) instead of **0.7** (70%).

**Would you like me to do this?**

## 📝 **What to Share**

Please run **Test 1** and **Test 2** from above and share:

1. **The filename** from Test 1
2. **The results** from Test 2 (especially the similarity scores)
3. **The question you asked** in the chat

This will tell us exactly what's wrong! 🎯
