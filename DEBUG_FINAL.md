# 🔍 Final Debug - Filename Filter Issue

## ✅ **What We Know**

1. ✅ Payload correct: `documentId: null`
2. ✅ OpenAI API working: Real embedding values
3. ✅ Chunks exist in DB: 18 chunks for "Tax filing in Austria in 2025.pdf"
4. ✅ Embeddings valid: 1536 dimensions
5. ✅ SQL test works: Returns chunks with similarity = 1.0
6. ❌ Live query: 0 chunks found

**The only remaining possibility**: Filename filter mismatch!

## 🎯 **Critical Test**

Run this SQL to see if the match function works WITHOUT the filename filter:

```sql
-- Test WITHOUT filename filter (to see if chunks are found at all)
SELECT 
  filename,
  chunk_index,
  similarity,
  substring(chunk_text, 1, 150) as preview
FROM match_document_chunks(
  query_embedding := (
    SELECT embedding::text 
    FROM document_chunks 
    WHERE filename = 'Tax filing in Austria in 2025.pdf'
    LIMIT 1
  ),
  match_threshold := 0.5,
  match_count := 5,
  filter_document_id := NULL,
  filter_filename := NULL  -- NO FILTER
)
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

**If this returns chunks**: The filename filter is the problem  
**If this returns nothing**: The match function itself is broken

## 🔍 **Then Check Exact Filename**

```sql
-- Compare exact bytes of filename
SELECT 
  filename,
  LENGTH(filename) as length,
  encode(filename::bytea, 'hex') as hex_encoding
FROM document_chunks
WHERE filename LIKE '%Tax filing%'
LIMIT 1;
```

This will show if there are hidden characters or encoding issues.
