# 🔍 RAG Still Not Working - Debugging Steps

## Issue 1: Q&A from File - Still No Results

**Possible Causes**:
1. Browser cache is serving old JavaScript (most likely)
2. The fix didn't deploy correctly
3. Something else is overriding the `documentId: null`

### Solution 1A: Force Browser to Get New Code

Try these in order:

**Option 1: Hard Refresh Multiple Times**
1. Go to: https://frontend-biosyvi28-patricks-projects-1d377b2c.vercel.app
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+R` **3 times**
3. Then `Cmd+Option+E` (to empty cache in DevTools)
4. Reload again

**Option 2: Incognito/Private Window**
1. Open a **new Incognito/Private window**
2. Go to: https://frontend-biosyvi28-patricks-projects-1d377b2c.vercel.app
3. Upload your PDF and ask a question

**Option 3: Check the Actual Code**
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Run this:
```javascript
// Check if the new code is loaded
console.log(document.querySelector('script[src*="index-DwnfnP2s.js"]'));
```
If this returns `null`, the old code is still cached.

### Solution 1B: Verify the Fix in Logs

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard Logs
2. Select `rag-query` function
3. Look for: `documentId: NULL` (should say NULL, not a UUID)

## Issue 2: Q&A from URL - File Too Large for OCR.space

**Error**: File is 2499 KB, but OCR.space free tier limit is 1024 KB (1 MB)

### Solution 2: Use Google Vision for URLs

The URL fetcher is pulling large PDFs that exceed OCR.space limits.

**I can update the code to**:
1. Automatically use **Google Vision** for URLs (supports larger files)
2. Or add **file size check** before OCR and show a better error

**Which would you prefer?**
- Use Google Vision for URL processing?
- Or show a clear error message for large files?

## 🔍 Quick Debug: Check Current Deployment

Run this in your browser console on the app page:

```javascript
// Check what version is loaded
const scripts = Array.from(document.scripts);
const mainScript = scripts.find(s => s.src.includes('index-'));
console.log('Loaded script:', mainScript?.src);

// Expected: should include "index-DwnfnP2s.js"
// If it shows a different hash, old code is cached
```
