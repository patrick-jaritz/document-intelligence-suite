# What "Deploy When Needed" Means

## 🤔 The Simple Answer

These 3 "missing" OCR services are **separate applications** that need to be:

1. **Deployed to a cloud server** (like AWS, Azure, Railway, Render)
2. **Running 24/7** so they can process OCR requests
3. **Accessible via URL** (like `https://deepseek-ocr.yourservice.com`)

Think of them as **separate apps** running on different computers that your main app would call over the internet.

## 📊 Visual Comparison

### What You Have NOW (Working):
```
Your Main App → Calls These APIs:
├─ OpenAI Vision API ✅ (Already running on OpenAI servers)
├─ Google Vision API ✅ (Already running on Google servers)
├─ Mistral Vision API ✅ (Already running on Mistral servers)
└─ OCR.space API ✅ (Already running on OCR.space servers)
```

### What's "Missing" (Optional):
```
Your Main App → Would Call:
├─ DeepSeek OCR ❌ (Needs YOUR server to run it)
├─ Dots.OCR ❌ (Needs YOUR server to run it)
└─ PaddleOCR ❌ (Needs YOUR server to run it)
```

## 💰 What Deployment Actually Involves

### 1. **Buy/Get Server Infrastructure**
- Cloud instance (AWS EC2, Azure VM, etc.)
- **Cost**: $50-$500/month depending on GPU needs
- **GPU Required**: For DeepSeek OCR (~$500/month for GPU)

### 2. **Set Up and Run the Service**
```bash
# On your cloud server:
cd services/deepseek-ocr-service
docker compose up -d  # Start the service
```

### 3. **Configure in Supabase**
```bash
# Set environment variable in Supabase dashboard:
DEEPSEEK_OCR_SERVICE_URL=https://deepseek-ocr.yourapp.com
```

### 4. **Keep It Running 24/7**
- Monitor for crashes
- Handle updates
- Pay for compute costs

## ✅ Why You DON'T Need This Now

**You already have 5 working OCR providers!**

1. ✅ OpenAI Vision - AI-powered, great accuracy
2. ✅ Google Vision - Very reliable, good for images  
3. ✅ Mistral Vision - Good alternative
4. ✅ OCR.space - Free tier available
5. ✅ Tesseract - Runs in browser, no limits

**Result**: Your system is 100% functional with these 5 providers!

## 🎯 When You WOULD Need to Deploy

You'd only deploy these 3 self-hosted services if:

1. **You need specific features** they offer (e.g., DeepSeek's bounding boxes)
2. **You want to avoid API costs** by self-hosting
3. **You want data privacy** by keeping processing in-house
4. **You need offline processing** (no internet required)

## 📈 Cost Comparison

| Provider | Type | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| OpenAI Vision | Cloud API | $0.01/image |
| Google Vision | Cloud API | $0.0015/image |
| **DeepSeek (Self-hosted)** | Your Server | **$500/month (GPU)** |
| Dots.OCR (Self-hosted) | Your Server | $50-200/month |
| PaddleOCR (Self-hosted) | Your Server | $50-200/month |

**Bottom Line**: Unless you're processing 50,000+ images/month, cloud APIs are cheaper!

## ✨ TL;DR

**"Deploy when needed" means:**

- These services are **not deployed** yet
- They're **optional** - your system works without them
- To deploy = Set up cloud servers, run the services, configure URLs
- **You don't need to do this** - you have 5 working alternatives

**Just ignore the "Missing" status** - it's totally fine! Your system is production-ready as-is. 🎉
