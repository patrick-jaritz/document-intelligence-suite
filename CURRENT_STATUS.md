# Current Status: Optional Self-Hosted OCR Providers

## üìä Summary

You have **5 working OCR providers** configured:
1. ‚úÖ OpenAI Vision
2. ‚úÖ Google Vision  
3. ‚úÖ Mistral Vision
4. ‚úÖ OCR.space
5. ‚úÖ Tesseract (Browser-based)

The 3 "missing" providers are **optional self-hosted services** that would require:

### 1. **Dots.OCR** (Optional)
- **Code Available**: `services/dots-ocr/`
- **Requires**: Deployment to cloud/self-hosted
- **When Needed**: Only if you want SOTA multilingual OCR
- **Status**: Currently using simulation/fallback
- **Priority**: Low (you have 5 providers working)

### 2. **PaddleOCR** (Optional)
- **Code Available**: `services/paddleocr/`
- **Requires**: Deployment to cloud/self-hosted
- **When Needed**: Only if you want open-source OCR
- **Status**: Currently using simulation/fallback
- **Priority**: Low (you have 5 providers working)

### 3. **DeepSeek OCR** (Optional)

## ‚úÖ Current Configuration is Perfect

**You don't need to fix anything!** 

The system is working with 5 real OCR providers. The 3 self-hosted services are:
- ‚úÖ Code-ready in the repository
- ‚è≥ Waiting for deployment when you need them
- üéØ Not required for the system to function

## üöÄ If You Want to Deploy Them Later

1. **DeepSeek OCR**: 
   ```bash
   cd services/deepseek-ocr-service
   # Deploy to AWS/Azure with GPU
   # Set: DEEPSEEK_OCR_SERVICE_URL
   ```

2. **Dots.OCR**:
   ```bash
   cd services/dots-ocr
   # Deploy to Railway/Vercel
   # Set: DOTS_OCR_SERVICE_URL
   ```

3. **PaddleOCR**:
   ```bash
   cd services/paddleocr
   # Deploy to cloud
   # Set: PADDLE_OCR_SERVICE_URL
   ```

**Bottom Line**: Your system is 100% functional with the current 5 OCR providers. The other 3 are optional enhancements you can deploy later if needed.
