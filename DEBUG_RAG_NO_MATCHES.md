# 🔍 RAG No Matches - Complete Debug Guide

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Database has chunks (you confirmed)
- ✅ RAG query returns 200 OK
- ✅ Threshold lowered to 0.5 (deployed)
- ❌ Still returning "No relevant information found"

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps: Find the Root Cause**

### Step 1: Check Console for Debug Info

1. **Go to**: https://frontend-fb8jl0dwc-patricks-projects-1d377b2c.vercel.app

2. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Open console** (Cmd+Option+I)

4. **Upload your PDF and ask a question**

5. **Look for this log**:
```
✅ RAG Response Data: {
  answer: "No relevant information found...",
  sources: 0,
  debug: {
    threshold: 0.5,
    filters: { filename: "...", documentId: "..." }
  }
}
```

**Share the `debug.filters` values** - specifically the `filename`.

---

### Step 2: Run SQL Diagnostics

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run this:

```sql
-- 1. What filenames are in the database?
SELECT DISTINCT 
  filename,
  COUNT(*) as chunk_count
FROM document_chunks
GROUP BY filename
ORDER BY MAX(created_at) DESC;

-- 2. Test match function with NO filters (baseline test)
SELECT 
  filename,
  chunk_index,
  similarity,
  substring(chunk_text, 1, 200) as preview
FROM match_document_chunks(
  query_embedding := (
    SELECT embedding::text 
    FROM document_chunks 
    ORDER BY created_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1
  ),
  match_threshold := 0.1,
  match_count := 5,
  filter_document_id := NULL,
  filter_filename := NULL  -- No filter
)
ORDER BY similarity DESC;

-- 3. Check if embeddings are valid vectors
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_chunks,
  COUNT(embedding) as non_null_embeddings,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL AND array_length(embedding::real[], 1) > 0) as valid_vectors
FROM document_chunks;
```

**Expected Results**:
- Query 1: Should show your filename (e.g., `BRAITER_INSIGHT.pdf`)
- Query 2: Should return 5 rows with similarity scores
- Query 3: `valid_vectors` should equal `total_chunks`

**If Query 2 returns nothing**: The `match_document_chunks` function itself is broken.

---

### Step 3: Possible Issues & Solutions

#### Issue A: Filename Mismatch
**Symptom**: Filename in console log doesn't match filename in database
**Example**: 
- Console: `BRAITER_INSIGHT.pdf`
- Database: `BRAITER INSIGHT.pdf` (space instead of underscore)

**Solution**: We need to normalize filenames or remove the filter.

---

#### Issue B: Embeddings are NULL
**Symptom**: Query 3 shows `valid_vectors = 0`
**Root Cause**: `generate-embeddings` function failed to store embeddings

**Solution**: Need to check `generate-embeddings` logs and fix the embedding storage.

---

#### Issue C: Match Function Broken
**Symptom**: Query 2 returns no rows
**Root Cause**: The `match_document_chunks` RPC function has an error

**Solution**: Need to recreate the function.

---

#### Issue D: Embedding Provider Mismatch
**Symptom**: Query 2 works but real queries don't
**Root Cause**: Documents were embedded with provider X but queries use provider Y (incompatible embeddings)

**Solution**: Use the same provider for both or re-embed documents.

---

## 🚀 **Quick Actions**

### Option 1: Remove Filename Filter (Test)

If you want to test without the filename filter, I can update the RAG query to search ALL documents instead of filtering by filename.

### Option 2: Re-embed Documents

Delete existing chunks and re-upload to ensure fresh embeddings:

```sql
DELETE FROM document_chunks;
```

Then upload your PDF again.

### Option 3: Lower Threshold Further

Change from 0.5 to 0.3 for maximum recall:
```typescript
match_threshold: 0.3  // Very permissive
```

## 📋 **Please Share**

To help me diagnose the exact issue, please share:

1. **The `debug.filters` from console** (especially the `filename`)
2. **Results from SQL Query 1** (what filenames are in DB)
3. **Results from SQL Query 2** (does match function work at all?)
4. **Results from SQL Query 3** (are embeddings valid?)

With this information, I can pinpoint the exact issue and fix it! 🎯
