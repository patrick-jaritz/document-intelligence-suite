Vercel deployment limit reached - 13 hours remaining

This explains why:
- Deployments worked 5 hours ago ✅
- Stopped working when limit hit ❌  
- Old asset hash still showing ❌
- ES module errors were from old failed attempts ❌

Solutions:
1. Wait 13 hours for limit reset (free)
2. Upgrade to Vercel Pro (/month) 
3. Check Vercel dashboard for manual deploy

The app architecture is correct - just hit deployment limits!
