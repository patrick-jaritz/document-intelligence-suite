# ✅ RAG Similarity Threshold Fix

## 🎯 **The Issue**

RAG query was returning 200 OK but "No relevant information found" even though chunks existed in the database.

**Root Cause**: Similarity threshold was **0.7 (70%)** which was too strict. Many valid matches were being filtered out because they didn't meet the 70% semantic similarity requirement.

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

### Updated `rag-query` Edge Function

**Changed**:
```typescript
match_threshold: 0.7  // Too strict ❌
```

**To**:
```typescript
match_threshold: 0.5  // Better balance ✓
```

**Impact**:
- **Before**: Only chunks with ≥70% similarity were returned
- **After**: Chunks with ≥50% similarity are returned
- **Result**: More relevant chunks found, better recall

---

## 🔍 **Enhanced Debugging**

Also added detailed logging to help diagnose future issues:

```typescript
if (chunks && chunks.length > 0) {
  console.log('Top chunk similarities:', chunks.map((c: any) => c.similarity).slice(0, 3));
} else {
  console.log('⚠️ No chunks found - check:');
  console.log('  - Threshold: 0.5');
  console.log('  - Filename filter:', filename);
  console.log('  - DocumentId filter:', documentId);
}
```

The error response now includes debug info:
```json
{
  "answer": "No relevant information found...",
  "sources": [],
  "debug": {
    "threshold": 0.5,
    "filters": { "filename": "...", "documentId": "..." }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Deployment**

```bash
✅ Deployed to Supabase Edge Functions
Project: joqnpibrfzqflyogrkht
Function: rag-query
Status: Live
```

## 🧪 **Test Now**

1. **Go to**: https://frontend-lp9oci4ul-patricks-projects-1d377b2c.vercel.app

2. **Hard refresh** (`Cmd+Shift+R`)

3. **Upload a PDF** (≤3 pages for OCR.space)

4. **Ask a question** about the document

5. **Expected**: You should now get relevant answers! 🎉

## 📊 **How to View Logs**

To see the new debug logs:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → rag-query
2. Look for:
   - `Top chunk similarities: [0.8, 0.75, 0.6]` ← Good matches
   - `⚠️ No chunks found` ← Still no matches (need lower threshold or different question)

---

## 🎛️ **Fine-Tuning Recommendations**

### Current Threshold: 0.5 (50%)

**If you're getting**:
- ✅ **Good results**: Keep at 0.5
- ❌ **Too many irrelevant results**: Increase to 0.6
- ❌ **Still no results**: Decrease to 0.3 or 0.4

**To adjust**, edit `supabase/functions/rag-query/index.ts` line 315:
```typescript
match_threshold: 0.5,  // Change this value
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
cd /Users/patrickjaritz/CODE/document-intelligence-suite
supabase functions deploy rag-query --project-ref joqnpibrfzqflyogrkht
```

## 🎓 **Understanding Similarity Scores**

- **0.9-1.0**: Nearly identical semantic meaning (very rare)
- **0.7-0.9**: Strong semantic similarity (good matches)
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate similarity (acceptable matches)
- **0.3-0.5**: Weak similarity (might be relevant)
- **<0.3**: Very weak similarity (likely irrelevant)

**Best Practice**: Start at 0.5 and adjust based on results.

---

## ✨ **Next Steps**

1. **Test with your PDF**
2. **Check the console logs** to see similarity scores
3. **Share results** if you still see "No relevant information found"
4. **We can adjust the threshold** further if needed
